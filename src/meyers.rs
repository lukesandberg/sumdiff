/// - http://www.xmailserver.org/diff2.pdf is the original paper that is quite readable.
/// - https://blog.jcoglan.com/2017/02/12/the-myers-diff-algorithm-part-1/ was a secondary resource
///   with more examples.

/// This implementation is very true to the paper. There are some slight differences to avoid dealing
/// with negative numbers as array indices.  The algorithm is O((N+M)D) where D is the length of the
